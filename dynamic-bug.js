This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js and involves dynamically generated content.  The issue is that Tailwind's purge functionality, which removes unused CSS classes, might remove classes that are only added to the DOM after the initial render. This leads to styles not being applied to dynamically rendered components or elements. For example, if you add a new element to the DOM using Javascript, and that element has Tailwind classes, those classes might be purged if they aren't present in your initial HTML.
